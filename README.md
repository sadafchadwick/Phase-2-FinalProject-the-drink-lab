# The Drink Lab

## Welcome to The Drink Lab!

Here we make fun drinks and generally have a good time! 

## Description

On the home page you see a carosel of some cool drink images.

In the about us, you can learn some about our drink lab process and about our invitation to join in the mixology!

Under cocktails you can see our current list of cocktails. Which is your favorite, a classic gin and tonic or a fun Malibu Bay Breeze?

The mockatils page shows our complete list of mocktails. Would you prefer a unique spitzer or a classic Shirley Temple?

Finally, head over to the add a drink page to become part of the mixology experience! Will you add a mocktail or cocktail? Something we've heard of before or something brand new?
